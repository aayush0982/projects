# Pokedex Project

Excited to share our latest project developed during MLH Api week, "Pokedex"!

In this innovative platform, the hero section features a dynamic slider showcasing newly added PokÃ©mon, as well as those receiving buffs and nerfs in ongoing series or games.

You'll find a comprehensive list of PokÃ©mon that can be easily filtered, and a convenient search bar to locate your favorites effortlessly.

Explore more details by clicking on any PokÃ©mon, directing you to a dedicated page filled with insightful descriptions, characteristics, abilities, stats, and much more.

We can't wait for you to experience the Pokedex! ðŸŒŸ
